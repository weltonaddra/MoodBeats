### Audio Reactive Visual Generator
Code for processing that uses either computer mic or "Big Sound" sensor connected to an Arduino


---------------------
#### Current Modes:
1. Computer Mic Mode: Uses the Minim library to read live audio from the laptop microphone.
2. Arduino Mic Mode: The Arduino sends live sound level numbers through USB port, and processing reads those in real time to animate the visuals. 
---------------------
#### Features:
- Real time microphone volume detection.
- Reactive visuals including flower style patterns and expanding sound bars.
- Randomized color palettes on startup (hot or cool themes).
